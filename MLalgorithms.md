## Families of ML algorithms
There are several categories for machine learning algorithms, below are some of these categories:
* Linear
    * Linear Regression
    * Logistic Regression
    * Support Vector Machines
* Tree-Based
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
    * GBDT
* KNN
* Neural Networks

-----------------------------
And if we  want to categorize ML algorithms with the type of learning, there are below type:
* Classification
    * k-Nearest Neighbors
    * LinearRegression
    * SVM
    * DT 
    * NN
    
* clustering
    * K-means
    * HCA
    * Expectation Maximization
    
* Visualization and	dimensionality 	reduction:
    * Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
    * Kernel PCA
    * Locally -Linear	Embedding 	(LLE)
    * t-distributed	Stochastic	NeighborEmbedding 	(t-SNE)
    
* Association rule learning
    * Apriori
    * Eclat
* Semisupervised learning
* Reinforcement Learning
    * Q-learning
* Batch learning & Online learning
* Ensemble  Learning
